Though PySpark is leading the way with a salary over 200k per year, it might not be as in demand as other skills so focusing on PySpark 
or any other highly paid skills would not be wise to focus on. I need to know which skills are both high paying and highly demanded.

Highest Paying Skills:

Go ($115K), Confluence ($114K), and Hadoop ($113K) are among the highest-paid skills.

Go is a high-performance language widely used in backend development, cloud computing, and microservices, which explains its strong salary potential.

Confluence being a high-paying skill suggests the demand for project management and collaboration tools in enterprise environments.

Hadoop remains relevant due to its role in big data processing.
